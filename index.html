      <div id="instructions">
        <p>Have you met Bella? She has been suffering from major constipation and diarrhea and feels like she's 9-months
          pregnant almost all the time. But it does not have to be that way, Bella can live a symptom-free lifestyle
          as long as she can establish some healthy habits. </p>
          <p><br>
          She loves food with onions, drinking and takes a lot of smoking breaks due to her stress, this creates
          so much pain for her. But with just a few simple habit changes, like water, sleep, eating healthy fruits
          like kiwi and doing regular exercises can help her improve her health again. 
          
          Are you up for a challenge to help Bella to get back to some healthy habits so she'll be pain-free again?
