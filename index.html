  <h1>Healthy Habits for People Living With Irritable Bowel Syndrome</h1>
  <div id="instructions">
    <p>Have you met Bella? She has been suffering from major constipation and diarrhea and feels like she's 9-months
        pregnant almost all the time. But it does not have to be that way, Bella can live a symptom-free lifestyle
        as long as she can establish some healthy habits.
    <p>
      <br>
        She loves food with onions, drinking and takes a lot of smoking breaks due to her stress, this creates
        so much pain for her. But with just a few simple habit changes, like water, sleep, eating healthy fruits
        like kiwi and doing regular exercises can help her improve her health again. 
      </p><br>
    <p>Are you up for a challenge to help Bella to get back to some healthy habits so she'll be pain-free again?
