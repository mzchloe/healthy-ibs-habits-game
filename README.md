Healthy IBS Habits

DESCRIPTION

You have been experiencing a lot of bowel problems lately with bloating, cramps and sometimes you have diarrhea and other times you have constipation. You have no idea what is wrong with you, so you go to your doctor and ask for help. Now, your doctor may or may not have diagnosed you with something called Irritable Bowel Syndrome also known as IBS, and all he tells you is that you are stressed and you need to relax. 

Well, thank you! That's all I needed to know...or not. Frustrating, right? 

Not knowing what can cause your symptoms can in fact cause you to start having stress you did not have before. So let's play see what are some basics things that will help you reduce your symptoms, and what can potentially cause your symptoms to be worse. 

The things that are good for reducing symptoms include but not limited to:
- Water: helps you stay hydrated
- Kiwi: increases your fibers and help relieve constipation
- Mindfulness: helps you release stress
- Exercise: helps you stay active and creates movement in your bowel 

The things that will increase your symptoms:
- Alcohol
- Onions: yes, unfortunately these little great tasting bastards does make you belly hurt more
- Greasy food: unfortunately these food will make your bowel worse
- Stress: a no-brainer, of course 

To stay healthy, you need to grab at least 20 healthy items and no more than 5 items. 

If you have more than 10 unhealthy items and only 10 healthy items or less, you will be dying from pain and crying for help, except that no one will help you because you chose all the unhealthy habits. 

We will give you two new chances though to make great habits again, you know what they say about "All the good things are 3" ;) 

GOOD LUCK!
